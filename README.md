# map-synchronization

This repository takes in data from a flatmap (in JSON format) and outputs differences and/or similarities.

The _2_map_comparison.py_ file takes in 2 JSON files and writes out desired data to an Excel spreadsheet. This is currently locked to only 2 map comparisons.

The _advanced_map_comparison.py_ file is a **WIP**, eventually becoming code that can take in any number of JSON files and return a clean Excel spreadsheet with the desired data.
